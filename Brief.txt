You are a developer for a company that sells movie DVDs.
The company website uses a third party datasource to manage its movies. The third party datasource is provided in MoviesLibrary.dll.

The following methods are provided in the third party datasource “MovieDataSource”
-	GetAllData
-	GetDataById
-	Create
-	Update

You will need to write a service (using C#.Net) which will be used by the company website to consume the third party datasource.
This service should be able to perform the following:
1) Fetch movies from the third party datasource.
2) Return movies in a sorted order by any of the movie attributes. (Except for the field “Cast”)
3) Search across all fields within the movie.
4) Insert new movie
5) Update existing movie.

Note:  Calling the third party data source is costly and data only gets updated every 24 hours. 

We can't provide any more information, so please make assumptions if you have any questions. Take as long as you like, although 60-90 minutes should be enough.

Please send completed response back as a 7z file (http://sourceforge.net/projects/sevenzip/files/7-Zip/9.20/7z920.msi/download?use_mirror=aarnet).
